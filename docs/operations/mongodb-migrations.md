# MongoDB Application Migrations

The application runs immutable, ordered MongoDB migrations before it becomes
ready. Every deployment must use a production backup taken before the migration
release. Application rollback does not reverse MongoDB data.

## Authoring Contract

- Add a new `ApplicationMigration` with a unique, ordered ID.
- Make the operation additive and idempotent wherever MongoDB permits it.
- Preserve compatibility with the previously deployed application version.
- Derive and review a stable SHA-256 checksum for the migration descriptor.
- Never edit the ID, checksum, or behavior of an applied migration. Use a new
  compensating migration when data or schema behavior must change.

The runner serializes deployments with the fixed `application-migrations` lease
in `application_leases`. Lifecycle records live in `application_migrations` and
use `RUNNING`, `APPLIED`, or `FAILED` status.

## Inspecting a Blocked Startup

Connect `mongosh` to the intended database, then inspect only the migration and
lease involved:

```javascript
db.application_migrations.find(
  {_id: "<migration-id>"},
  {checksum: 1, description: 1, status: 1, startedAt: 1, completedAt: 1,
    failureCategory: 1})
db.application_leases.find(
  {_id: "application-migrations"},
  {acquiredAt: 1, expiresAt: 1})
```

A checksum mismatch, `RUNNING` record, or `FAILED` record intentionally stops
startup. Correct the underlying failure first. Confirm no deployment is active
and that the lease is absent or expired. If the operation was not safely
idempotent, restore the pre-deployment backup instead of editing migration state.

Only after the cause is corrected, the backup is confirmed, and the affected
data is known safe may an operator remove the single incomplete record:

```javascript
db.application_migrations.deleteOne({_id: "<exact-incomplete-migration-id>"})
```

Record that bounded recovery in the deployment report and restart the
application. Never delete the collection, all migration records, or unrelated
leases.
